			<p>VCP is a production house located in Reno Nevada that specializes in event planning and audio production services. Client provided a creative brief identifying a need for a branding with modern and innovative look yet something with a fresh and delicious feel, something simple and timeless and memorable.</p>
			<p>We knew we had to come up with something unique and versatile. A logo that reflects the brand but also point to videography. After we showed our first mock to client, we were awarded with the project and we end up designing a logo and a website</p>
